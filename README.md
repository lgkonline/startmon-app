# Startmon App
Startmon should be your gateway and hub for other services!  
Connect it with services you love and use everyday, like Twitter or Instagram. And find new resources that might interest you, like blogs about your favorite hobby. Or discover people who do crazy stuff on DeviantArt or Instagram. Or just people who are like you.  
All that combined in one pretty app on your homescreen.

# Startmon as "blog finder"?
There are so many awesome blogs out there. But sometimes it's just a little difficult to find them. Startmon could be a place where you can discover articles that be interesting for you. Or let you subscribe to blogs and you could get notified if there is a new article.
So something like a more modern RSS reader. ðŸ¤”
